# NBA Song of the Year
made by Gary Williams, Pete Hodenfield, and Vee Crichton-Hill

## Purpose

Our application uses a clean and simple design to merge the interests of NBA statistics and music. All you do is enter in the name of your favorite NBA player and you immediately get stats such as their jersey number, current team, and draft year. We wanted to add a fun spin to it and also pull up the most popular song of the year that the player was drafted. The search bar stays within reach so you can easily search for another playerâ€™s stats. The application also uses local storage to remember your most recent searches. This concept can be used as a base for even more features such as showing more statistics and videos of player highlights.
